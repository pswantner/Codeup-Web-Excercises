            <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-2">So, what do you say? We got a basket full of father-son fun here. What's Kama Sutra oil? Maybe it's not for us. You just grab that brownish area by its points and you don't let go no matter what your mother tells you! And guess what else is back. [slow wink] My breakfast? My friskiness. Mama horny Michael. Oh, like when they say "poofter" to mean "tourist", yes. Buster, what are you doing with mother's rape horn? What, so the guy we are meeting with can't even grow his own hair? COME ON! You can control your bladder when you're dead! [Stabbing Gob] White power! Gob: I'm white!

              Don't call my escorts whores. I'm foolish and I'm funny and I'm needy. Am I needy? Are you sure I'm not needy? 'Cause I feel needy sometimes. I didn't get into this business to please sophomore Tracy Schwartzman, so… onward and upward. On… Why, Tracy?! Why?!! And although the intervention didn't work, it turned into one of the Bluth family's better parties. I need a fake passport, preferably to France…I like the way they think. Daddy horny, Michael. Fried cheese… with club sauce. Popcorn shrimp… with club sauce. Chicken fingers… with spicy club sauce. Today I learned this is a real place, tho more lush than the OC.

              I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense. No, no, it's pronounced a-nal-ra-pist.

              You go buy a tape recorder and record yourself for a whole day. I think you'll be surprised at some of your phrasing. I made a huge tiny mistake.

              He… she… what's the difference? Oh hear, hear. In the dark, it all looks the same. Early. No borders, no limits… go ahead, touch the Cornballer… you know best? Yes, he's like the steel man from The Wizard From Oz. The only thing more terrifying than the escaped lunatic's hook was his twisted call… Hey campers! Bob Loblaw Lobs Law Bomb. The worst that could happen is that I could spill coffee all over this $3,000 suit. COME ON.

                One for the ladies. She's a contestant. It's sorta like an inner beauty   pageant. Ah, there it is. Boy, I sure feel like a Mary without a Peter and a Paul. You burn down the storage unit? Oh, most definitely. I hear the jury's still out on science. So, what do you say? We got a basket full of father-son fun here. What's Kama Sutra oil? Maybe it's not for us.

              I hear the jury's still out on science. Well, yeah you've gotta lock that down. Oh, COME ON! They frame my junk. So, what do you say? We got a basket full of father-son fun here. What's Kama Sutra oil? Maybe it's not for us.

              ¡Soy loco por los Cornballs! Great, now I'm gonna smell to high heaven like a tuna melt! Maybe it was the other George Michael. You know, the singer-songwriter. Fried cheese… with club sauce. Popcorn shrimp… with club sauce. Chicken fingers… with spicy club sauce.

              My brother wasn't optimistic it could be done, but I didn't take "wasn't optimistic it could be done" for an answer. Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. Sorry, some of my students are arguing the significance of the shankbone on the seder plate. But we do not - NOT wag our genitals at one another to make a point. ♪♪ It ain't easy being white… ♪♪ Oh, I don't have any drugs for sale, unless… did you want me to follow you to your car? Stop it, stop it. This objectification of women has to stop. Michael: It's just Mom and whores.

            <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-2">Butterscotch! Want a lick? In the mid '90s, Tobias formed a folk music band with Lindsay and Maebe which he called Dr. Funke's 100 Percent Natural Good Time Family Band Solution. The group was underwritten by the Natural Food Life Company, a division of Chem-Grow, an Allen Crayne acqusition, which was part of the Squimm Group. Their motto was simple: We keep you alive. Can you believe that the only reason the club is going under is because it's in a terrifying neighborhood?
